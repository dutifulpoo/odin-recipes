    <h1>Raspberry White Chocolate Scones</h1>
    <img src="../images/scone.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>In this scone recipe, I used dried raspberries to add intense flavor and replaced some of the butter with grated white chocolate. The result? Perfectly textured, tender, and light scones that weren't too delicate or crumbly. Definitely some of the best I've ever had! Serve with a nice cup of tea.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Rasperries</li> 
       <li>Flour</li>
       <li>Sugar</li>
       <li>Salt</li>
       <li>Baking Powder</li>
       <li>Butter</li>
       <li>Milk</li>
       <li>Sour Cream</li>
       <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner.</li>
        <li>Place fresh raspberries about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 4 hours, then turn oven off, leaving the berries inside for 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone liner.</li>
        <li>Roughly chop dried raspberries into smaller pieces and measure out ½ cup for this recipe. Reserve any extra for another use.</li>
        <li>Grate white chocolate on the fine side of a grater until you have ½ cup.</li>
        <li>Whisk 2 cups flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl. Grate cold butter into the flour mixture, tossing every so often to coat it with flour so it doesn't start to clump. When all butter has been added, work it into the flour with a pastry blender. Add grated white chocolate and toss with a fork to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Whisk ¾ cup milk and sour cream together in a liquid measure, then pour that into the flour mixture. Mix with a fork until everything just barely comes together to form a shaggy dough.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a generously floured work surface and without kneading, push and pack it together with your hands until it holds its shape, adding a little flour if it's too sticky. Press dough into a rectangle, about ¾-inch thick, and roughly twice as long as it is wide.</li>
    </ol>
